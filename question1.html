    <h1> The Amazing Water Cycle: Nature&rsquo;s Magical Journey!
    </h1>
    <p> Have you ever wondered where rain comes from or where it goes after it hits the ground? Welcome to the magical world of the water cycleâ€”a never-ending adventure that keeps our planet hydrated and happy!

    <!-- Information -->
     <h2>Step 1: The Sun</h2>
     <p>It all starts with the sun! When the sun shines down on oceans, lakes, and rivers, it warms the water and turns some of it into tiny, invisible water vapor. This process is called evaporation. 
     </p>
     <h2>Step 2: Up, Up, and Away</h2>
     <p>As the water vapor rises into the sky, it cools down and changes back into tiny water droplets. This process is called condensation. These droplets come together to form clouds. 
     </p>
     <h2>Step 3: The Big Splash</h2>
     <p>When clouds become heavy with water droplets, they release the water back to the ground. This is called precipitation, and it can be rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
     </p>
     <h2>Step 4: Water into the Ground</h2>
     <p>Once the precipitation hits the ground, it starts a new journey. Some of it soaks into the soil and becomes part of the groundwater, which plants use to grow. This is called infiltration. The groundwater can also flow through underground channels, feeding into lakes and rivers.
     </p>
     <h2>Step 5: Water Under the Bridge</h2>
     <p>Some of the water flows over the ground into streams, rivers, and eventually back into oceans. This is called runoff.
     </p>
     <h2>Step 6: Plant Power</h2>
     <p>Plants also join the water cycle! They take in water from the soil and release it back into the air through a process called transpiration.
